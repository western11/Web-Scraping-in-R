## Library and setup

In this **Library and Setup** section you’ll see some code to initialize our workspace, and the packages we’ll be using for this introductory session of this workshop. 

_Packages_ are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format. The directory where packages are stored is called the _library_. R comes with a standard set of packages. Others are available for download and installation. Once installed, they have to be loaded into the session to be used. 

You will need to use `install.packages()` to install any packages that are not yet downloaded onto your machine. To install packages, type the command below on your console then press ENTER.

```{r eval=FALSE}
## DO NOT RUN CHUNK
# packages <- c("dplyr", "rvest")
# 
# install.packages(packages)
```

Then you need to load the package into your workspace using the `library()` function. Special for this course, the _rmarkdown_ packages do not need to be called using `library()`.

```{r}
# package for data wrangling
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)

# package for string manipulation
library(stringr)

# package for web scraping
library(rvest)
library(RSelenium)
library(httr)

# package for data exploratory
library(ggplot2)
```


# Introduction to R

## Why Learn R?

1. **Built by Statisticians, for Statisticians.**

  R is a statistical programming language created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the Department of Statistics, at the University of Auckland (New Zealand). R is created for data analysis and,as such,is different from traditional programming languages. [R](https://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/rro) is not just a statistical programming language, it is a complete environment for data analyst and the most widely used data analysis software today.

2. **Plentiful Libraries.**

  R provides numerous additional packages for which add out-of-the-box functionalities for various uses: statistical tests, time-series analysis, beautiful visualization, and various machine learning tasks such as regression algorithms, classification algorithms, and clustering algorithms. The R community is noted for its active contributions in terms of packages.

3. **Open Source.**

  Part of the reason for its active and rapidly growing community is the open-source nature of R. Users can contribute packages–many of which packaged some most advanced statistical tools and customized templates for visualization that is not found in other commercials, proprietary statistical computing software. In the first section of Library and Setup, we have prepared 4 main packages where 3 of them are developed by the R community.

4. **Used by The Biggest Software Companies in The World.**

  Dive deeper into R’s analytical capability, R has been used not only for descriptive analytics but also to develop machine learning and artificial intelligence project of major software companies in the world. 
 
5. **Ready for Big Data**

  `RHadoop`, `ParallelR`, Revolution R Enterprise, and a handful of other toolkits adds powerful big data support, allowing data engineers to create custom parallel and distributed algorithms to handle parallel / map-reduce programming in R. This makes R a popular choice for big data analytics and high performance, enterprise-level analytics platform.
 

## Navigating R Studio

Before we venture further into data analysis, we’ll take one step back to familiarize ourselves with the tools we will use. By now, you should be able to install **R** and **R Studio** in your machine. But what is the difference between the two? R and R Studio is a different application, and each has its role.

Not to be confused with R language, R Studio, is a supplementary application *made for streamlining the workflow of working with R*, this type of application is commonly known as _Integrated Development Environment_ (IDE) (See Fig. \@ref(fig:r-rstudio)). The application you are opening right now is called R Studio and under the hood, R Studio is communicating with an R session by sending the command on the chunk above through the *console* Window on the bottom of the application. If you strip down R Studio to its very core, really the R console on the bottom is the same one as R console when you open the original R application on your machine.

```{r r-rstudio, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center",fig.width=7,fig.height=6, fig.cap="Relationship between R and RStudio"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rrstudio.PNG")
```

In the beginning of this chapter, we have discussed the main difference between R and R Studio. In R Studio, you might notice a few windows, if you’re reading this on R Markdown file, you’ll be looking at the *Source Pane* in R Studio. Now let’s take alook at the default layout of R Studio:

```{r rstudio, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="R Studio Panes"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudiopanes.PNG")
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:rstudio), you can find that there are 4 main panes for you to familiarize yourself with:    

1. **Source Pane**: This pane displays the original file opened using R Studio. This is the main feature of R Studio, since it is essentiallya file editor application equipped with a s of features that support your works.    

2. **Console Pane**: This pane displays the _original R console_ used to communicate with R session. There are also tabs such as _Terminal_ used for accessing your machine command-line interface.    

3. **Environment / History Pane**: This pane display all created R variables in the session. There are also tabs such as History if you need to trace back your previous ran codes.    

4. **Fourth Pane** consist of multiple tabs:   

  - **Files Pane**: List the files in your working directory    
  - **Plots Pane**: Display visualization output    
  - **Packages Pane**: List all installed and loaded packages    
  - **Help Pane**: Display the official documentation for functions   

The mainfocus in using R Studio should be on the source pane where you can edit your files. 

In this course, we will be using an _R Markdown_ file. It is one of the tools that has a deep integration with R Studio and its functionalityis developed within `rmarkdown` package. The package is made for easy development of dynamic document tool for R. R Markdown turn our analysis into high-quality reports. 

If you take alook at the original project directory, you should see there are sever files with under `.Rmd` extension, `HTML` file, and `PDF` file. The HTML and PDF are generated using R Markdown functionality: **knit**.

For example, in this R-markdown it consists of 2 things: R chunk and Narration. If you see something with the following shade in R markdown file:

![](img/chunk.png){ width=200% }

You are looking at an R chunk where you can put your codes and interact with R, and even getting the result right on the file itself. 

R is a programming language, where a set of instructions will be translated into computer language. Try to run the following chunk using the green play button on the top right or use the shortcut `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Enter`:

```{r}
# This is a code example
city <- c("Jakarta", "Surabaya", "Medan")
print(city)
```

The previous command written in R is to store multiple values into a variable called `region`, then by using `print()`,  we instruct to return all values stored in the variable. Also, notice the “#” character in the first line of the code chunk, indicating to R that it’s a comment and should be ignored.


Other than R chunk, the document is structured using markdown syntax which is common to create a formatted report. You can add your own R chunk with two options:  

a. Use a shortcut of `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`I`  
b. Use the Insert button on the top right of your source pane and choose R    

> **Dive Deeper 1**:  

1. Insert a new chunk below (you can choose whatever is convenient for you; whether by using a shortcut or the insert button)!  
2. In the chunk you just created, try to type `1+100`. Run the chunk and see what happen! 
3. In the same chunk, create a new line and try to type `1 == 1`. Run the chunk again and see what happen!


__*Notes: Running the code chunk*__  
RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. To run the current line, you can [^3]:

  a. click on the Run button above the editor panel, or<br>
  b. select “Run Lines” from the “Code” menu, or<br>
  c. hit `Ctrl`+`Enter` in Windows, `Ctrl`+`Return` in Linux, or `⌘`+`Return` on OS X.
  d. To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`.

  
# R Programming Basics

## Variables and Assignment

As we have mentioned in the earlier section, R is one of the most popular tools in working with data. In R, you will store a data in an R object. The object is stored in a memory for each R session and is stored under an assigned name. This is an example of creating an R object:  

```{r}
address <- "Algoritma Data Science School, Jl. Prof. DR. Satrio No.164, RT.4/RW.4"
```

If you run the chunk above, you should see a newly created variable in the environment pane called `address`. This way, we could easily call every object we have created using the variable name:

```{r}
address
```

> **Dive Deeper 2**:  

```r
# an example of storing multiple values into a variable:
inventory <- c("itemA","itemB", "itemC")
```

1. Insert a new chunk below (again, you can choose whatever is convenient for you; whether by using a shortcut or the insert button)!  
2. Create a new variable, name it `participants`, pick at least 3 random names from the participants in this Zoom meeting (you may also use your friends' name if you are not joining the Zoom session)! 
3. Try to call again the values you just stored in `participants`, but change the text to uppercase (`PARTICIPANTS`) and see what happen!


_**Notes: Creating a Variable**_:  

1. You need to name an object and use the `<-` to assign a value 
2. An object name needs to start with an alphabet, can contain alphanumerics, dots (`.`), and underscores (`_`)  
3. R is case-sensitive so “participants” and “PARTICIPANTS” are different symbols and will point to different variables.

```{r}
# Uncomment the code below by remove the `#` sign and see what happen:
# participants == PARTICIPANTS
```
4. A value could have a different form than a sentence of: "itemA" which we will discuss in the next section.

## Class Variables

The most basic form of R object is a vector. In math, a vector is used to denotes magnitude and direction which is also implemented in R. The previous `address` stored a value of: "Algoritma Data Science School, Jl. Prof. DR. Satrio No.164, RT.4/RW.4" and it stores the value as a **character class**. There are 5 basic class variables in R:

```{r}
# character
character <- c("Algoritma", "Indonesia", "123@xyz.com", "Jakarta")

# numeric
numeric <- c(-1, 1, 2, 3/4, 0.5)

# integer
integer <- c(1L, 2L)

# logical
logical <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)

# complex
complex <- c(1+3i, (1+3i)*2)
```

To check each of the 5 variable’s class, use the `class()` function and see if each return the correct class names:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Complete the code below

class(...)
```

Later on, we’ll see exactly why understanding the type is important when we imported the dataset on the next section: Exploratory Analysis. We will also dive deeper into getting to know two other important classes later on: **Factor** and **Date**.

A vector, however, has a certain rule to be followed: Inside a single vector, all needs to be within one class. Let’s take alook at the following example:

```{r}
example <- c(TRUE, 1L, 3, 4/5)
example
```

See how some value of `TRUE` is transformed into 1? This process is known as **implicit coercion** where vector’s values are **forced** into one type of class based on the most general value existing. Let’s take alook at the following illustration:

```{r classlevel, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Class level in R"}
 knitr::include_graphics("img/classlevel.PNG")
```

Fig. \@ref(fig:classlevel) shows the hierarchy of R object’s class from the most specific (inward) to the most general (outward). An implicit coercion will follow the rules of transforming the value into the most general ones, means the previous vector of `c(TRUE, 1L, 3, 4/5)` will be coerced into the most general one, in this case, numeric:

```{r}
class(example)
```

> **Dive Deeper 3:**

Based on your understanding of vector’s class and implicit coercion, what do you think each of the vectors class are? 

- `c(TRUE, "TRUE", 1, 1L)`
- `c(FALSE, 0L, TRUE, 1)`
- `c(FALSE, 0L, FALSE, TRUE)`


## DataFrame Object

Since we have learned about **vector** and **class** we will now discuss other type of object. Consider this case:
  
*You are working in an e-commerce company and is given the invoices data from 2019 in tabular format. Can you imagine how will the data look like? How would you store the data?*

A **data frame** is the most common way of storing data in R, and if used systematically makes data analysis easier. Under the hood, a data frame is a *list* of equal-length vectors. [^4] Now, let's take a look at an example of a dataframe below:

```{r}
invoice <- data.frame(
 invoice.id = 1005:1009,
 purchase.amt = c(560400, 701300, 350300, 421600,321000),
 purchase.date = as.Date(c("2020-01-02","2020-01-02","2020-01-02","2020-02-03","2020-02-03")),
 cust.name = c("Shello", "Ardhito", "Arlene", "Bagas", "Cipto"),
 address = factor(c("Denpasar", "Bogor", "Jakarta", "Surabaya", "Jakarta"))
)

invoice
```
> **Dive Deeper 4:**

1. Recall how to use `class()` to return class attribute of an R object. Create a new chunk below, and use the function call on  `invoice`!
2. To access the column of a dataframe, you can use the syntax of `data$column`. Try to use the `class()` function on `invoice$address`, what value did the function call return? What about `invoice$purchase.amt`?
